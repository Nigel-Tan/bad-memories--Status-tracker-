Also comes with a function to check current online users in the text channel (non bot users), the function is /bmbot whoalive
Note that the function name can be changed as needed, you will however need to also change all the code in main which uses the specific function name (whoalive for this case)

# Deployment guide
This code was initially meant to be able to be directly copied and used onto replit, however with the changes of replit now neededing payment method of sorts to keep it going continously, you can either self host and run the files yourself, or look for alterntive services.

Note: The main python files are main.py and keep_alive.py
